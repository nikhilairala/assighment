# CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application

This repository demonstrates how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes
## Pipeline Workflow

1. Tests: Every time a pull request is created or updated on the `main` branch, the pipeline will run automated tests.
2. Build: After passing tests, the pipeline will build a Docker image and push it to Docker Hub.
3. Deploy: The image will be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.
4. Notifications: Notifications will be sent to a Slack channel to indicate whether the deployment was successful or failed.

## Setting Up

1. Docker: Ensure that you have a Docker Hub account and configure the Docker Hub credentials as GitHub Secrets.
2. Kubernetes: Set up a Kubernetes cluster and create a service account with appropriate permissions to allow deployment updates. Add the `K8S_TOKEN` as a GitHub secret.
3. Slack: Set up a Slack app and create a webhook URL to send notifications to a Slack channel.

## Deployment

Once the CI/CD pipeline is configured, every pull request to the `main` branch will automatically trigger the pipeline:
- Run tests.
- Build the Docker image.
- Deploy to Kubernetes.
- Notify via Slack.

## Conclusion

This setup helps in automating the deployment pipeline for a Node.js application with tests, Docker builds, and Kubernetes deployments, along with Slack notifications for deployment status.
